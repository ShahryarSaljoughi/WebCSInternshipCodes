# How to use my framework

You want to add some beautiful icons to your html pages.  
to do that, define a *span* tag whose class is the name of the icon, sth like: actions-icon
In addition, you need to apply the css class *icon-parent* to the parent of the span tag!

by default, the icon won't be visible unless its parent is hovered over.
